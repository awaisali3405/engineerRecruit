                            From You</h4>
                        <p>
                            You will be invited to accept jobs if you have set your app to online. This will be via sms,
                            email and the
                            PM247 app. An initial investigation, diagnosis and small repair price will be agreed with the
                            customer. This
                            information will be within the sms, email and on the PM247 App. Should you accept the invitation
                            you will be
                            placed into the pool of accepted engineers and if successful you will be assigned the job. You
                            will not be
                            given the customers telephone number as all communication will be done through our office but
                            will receive
                            the full address of the job on the app and by sms requesting you attend the job.

                            Upon arrival at site, introduce yourself from PM247 and proceed to diagnose the problem. DO NOT
                            FIX. Call
                            the office when you know what you have to do, no matter how small the fix. Prior to leaving site
                            at the end of
                            the job you are to always call the office to confirm full payment on the job has been made, you
                            can check this
                            also on the PM247 app under the financial screen. It is important that the customer inspects all
                            work carried
                            out as any call back will result in loss of money as it will be your responsibility to undertake
                            the call back and
                            if you are unable to attend, another engineer will return at your expense. We recommend you
                            carry out you
                            own call backs to avoid work being done that is not related to your original work. All work
                            carried out by
                            yourself must meet the requirement of all rules and regulations applicable.
